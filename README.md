# Abstract
Bike sharing systems are brand new revolutionary systems which automates the entire process of membership, rental and return back. This makes the life of both users and bike providers easier. Not only that, it also plays an important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. Currently, there are more than 500 hundred bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Keep tracking of the total amount of bike rented per hour of this gigantic quantity of bikes is almost impossible for humans. This paper applies machine learning algorithms to make predicitons on the total amount of bike rented per hour with the help of the dataset provided by Capital bikeshare system between years 2011 and 2012. Results are unfortunately very inaccurate and further fine-tuning and more features are needed to get better results
